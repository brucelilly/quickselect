/********************** Long description and rationale: ***********************
 Partitioning can result in an unfavorable split of the initial sub-array;
 when this happens, an emergency "break-glass" pivot selection function is used
 to ensure a better split, avoiding quadratic behavior even when handling a
 worst-case input array, such as can be generated by an adversary function
 (M. D. McIlroy "A Killer Adversary for Quicksort").
 The tables defined by this file determine how lopsided a prtition may be before
 the large region is repartitioned.

/*
   Repivoting with median-of medians always results in a ratio of the large
      region size to the remaining elements less than 3:1 (worst case is at size
      8 (2 sets of 3, with 2 elements left over; largest possible large region
      size is 6 for a ratio of 3:1), but sub-arrays of size 8 are never
      repivoted; the practical worst case is then at size 14 (4 sets of 3, with
      2 elements left over; worst case large region size 10 for a ratio of
      5:2)).
   With 729 or more samples, the ratio of the large region size to the remaining
      elements is rarely as high as 3:1, so factor2 and factor1 for those
      repivot table entries can safely be set to 3UL without any noticeable
      effect on the performance for random and/or frequently encountered
      structured input sequences.
   The factor2 member is set by finding the worst-case adversarial performance
      for sorting and for selection, and reducing the factor2 value at the
      appropriate max_nmemb entry to eliminate that worst-case performance,
      repeating the process until some desired absolute worst-case is achieved
      or the worst-case performance point cannot be eliminated by reducing
      factor2.
   When factor2 reduction is no longer able to eliminate a worst-case
      performance point, factor1 may be reduced to eliminate the worst-case
      performance point. This may be repeated (after first trying factor2!)
      until a desired absolute worst-case performance point is reached, no
      further improvement can be obtained using factor2 and factor1, or the
      elimination of a worst-case performance point entails too large of a
      performance penalty for random input sequences.
