/********************** Long description and rationale: ***********************
 This file contains source to implement the public functions qsort and qsort_s.
 It is based on an implementation of multiple quickselect similar to that
 described by Mahmoud & Lent in "Average-case analysis of multiple Quickselect:
 An algorithm for finding order statistics".  The array of items to be sorted by
 quickselect, the array element size, and the comparison function are declared
 as for qsort, with two additional parameters to specify an optional array of
 desired order statistic ranks.
 N.B. the values for the order-statistic array elements are zero-based ranks
 (i.e. 0UL for the minimum, N-1UL for the maximum of an array of N elements,
 (N-1UL)/2UL and N/2UL for the lower- and upper-medians).
 The implementation can also be used to implement qsort; a wrapper function
 (which could alternatively be implemented as a macro) is provided for that
 purpose.
 In order to be able to compute the rank of array elements for selection, the
 initial array base is maintained, and a pair of indices brackets the sub-array
 being processed.  The indices correspond to the ranks of elements.  A similar
 scheme is used by Musser's introsort, described in "Introspective Sorting and
 Selection Algorithms".  The same method is used for the array of desired order
 statistic ranks, similar to that described by Lent & Mahmoud.
 Pivot selection uses Rousseeuw & Basset's remedian, described in "The Remedian:
 A Robust Averaging Method for Large Data Sets", on a sample of a size which is
 a power of 3 taken from the array elements, with sample size approximately the
 square root of the array size as described in "Optimal Sampling Strategies for
 Quicksort" by McGeoch and Tygar, and in "Optimal Sampling Strategies in
 Quicksort and Quickselect" by Martinez and Roura.
 Elements sampled from the array for use by the pivot selection methods are
 chosen to provide good overall performance, avoiding choices that would fare
 poorly for commonly-seen input sequences (e.g. organ-pipe, already-sorted).
 Partitioning uses a method described by Bentley & McIlroy, with a modification
 to reduce disorder induced in arrays.
 Comparisons are made between array elements; there is no special-case code nor
 initialization macro.
 Partitioning can still result in an unfavorable split of the initial sub-array;
 when this happens, an emergency "break-glass" pivot selection function is used
 to ensure a better split, avoiding quadratic behavior even when handling a
 worst-case input array, such as can be generated by an adversary function
 (M. D. McIlroy "A Killer Adversary for Quicksort").
 Break-glass pivot selection uses median-of-medians using sets of 3 elements
 (ignoring leftovers) and using a call to quickselect to find the median of
 medians, rather than recursion.  Aside from those details, it is similar to the
 method described by Blum, Floyd, Pratt, Rivest, & Tarjan in "Time Bounds for
 Selection".
 Swapping of elements is handled by efficient inline swap functions.  No attempt
 is made to optimize for specific array element types, but swapping can be
 performed in units of basic language types.  The swap functions avoid useless
 work (e.g. when given two pointers to the same element).  No specialized macros
 are required.
