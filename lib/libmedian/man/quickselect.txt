[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       The   [1mquickselect  [22mfunction  implements  multiple  selection  of  order
       statistics.  Given an array  [1mpk  [22mof  [1mnk  [4m[22msize_t[24m  elements  representing
       0-based  order  statistic ranks, [1mquickselect [22mpartially orders the array
       [1mbase [22msuch that the specified  order  statistics  are  in-place  in  the
       array.   If  [1mpk  [22mis  [4mNULL[24m  or  [1mnk  [22mis  0UL, a full sort of the array is
       performed.

[1mRETURN VALUES[0m
       none

[1mERRORS[0m
       If [1mbase [22mis [4mNULL[24m, [1mnmemb [22mis 0UL, [1msize [22mis 0UL,  or  [1mcompar  [22mis  [4mNULL[24m,  the
       global variable [4merrno[24m is set to [1mEINVAL[22m.

       size_t karray[2];
       karray[0] = (nmemb-1UL)/2UL;
       karray[1] = nmemb/2UL;
       quickselect(base, nmemb, size, compar, karray, 2UL);

       places  the  median  ([1mnmemb [22modd)  or medians ([1mnmemb [22meven) in the middle
       element(s) of the array pointed to by [1mbase.   [22mRefer  to  the  BUGS  and
       CAVEATS section regarding duplicated order statistic ranks.

       quickselect(base, nmemb, size, compar, NULL, 0UL);

       sorts the array.

[1mAPPLICATION USAGE[0m
       If  the  macro  [1mQSORT_FUNCTION_NAME  [22mis defined before [4mquickselect.h[24m is
       included when compiling the [4mquickselect.c[24m source,  a  sorting  function
       with  the  same  semantics  as  [1mqsort [22mis generated, using the specified
       name.  A library implementation of [1mqsort [22mmay be generated  by  defining
       [1mQSORT_FUNCTION_NAME [22mas [1mqsort[22m.

[1mRATIONALE[0m
       While  many  libraries  include  a standard [1mqsort [22mfunction, those [1mqsort[0m
       implementations may tend to quadratic performance  on  adverse  inputs.
       Many  implementations  exhibit  poor  performance  for  some  types  of
       structured  input  sequences,  such  as   reverse-sorted   or   rotated
       sequences.   Few  libraries  provide  a function for selection of order
       statistics.  Those libraries  that  do  provide  a  selection  function
       usually  only permit selection of a single order statistic per function
       call.

[1mBUGS and CAVEATS[0m
       Array [1mpk [22mmay be sorted by [1mquickselect [22mand therefore initially  unsorted
       order  statistic ranks may be permuted by a call to [1mquickselect[22m.  It is
       recommended (but not required) that the order statistics  array  [1mpk  [22mbe
       supplied in sorted order.

       If array [1mpk [22mcontains duplicated ranks, those duplicates will be ignored
       during processing  and  will  be  grouped  together  by  sorting  after
       processing.   This  may  be  expensive  if  a  large  number  of  order
       statistics are specified and there is at least one  duplicate.   It  is
       recommended  (but  not  required)  that  the  order statistics array [1mpk[0m
       contain no duplicates.

       [1mquickselect [22mhas expected and worst-case linear complexity for finding a
       single   order  statistic.   Worst-case  selection  of  multiple  order
       statistics is linearithmic.  [1mquickselect [22mhas  expected  and  worst-case
       linearithmic complexity for sorting.
